{"text":["What particular food wouldn't you eat growing up but you tried later as an adult you now enjoy eating?","Most food. Turns out my parents just couldn't cook.","Lasagna. My mom made it with cottage cheese and raw mushroom slices that came out like Styrofoam. It was nasty. I didn't have it done right until I was an adult.","I've eaten more onions willingly in the last year than in the previous 47 years of my life combined.","Cruciferous vegetables.  Broccoli.  Brussel Sprouts.  I wouldn't touch it if it was green.\n\nNow they're my favorite.  I air fry Brussel Sprouts for snacks.  Yum.","Raw tomatoes. I hated them so much in sandwiches, now I put them in all my sandwiches. Funny thing is, my fam still thinks I hate them, so when ever we have a cookout or something, they always give me burgers without tomatoes. I‚Äôm kinna shy to admit to them my new found love.","Sushi","Pork chops. It was so disappointing as a kid that you were having pork chops for dinner. My bf and I recently randomly decided to buy them and see if we like them now and (unsurprisingly) it turns out our parents just didn‚Äôt know how to season or cook them right.","Wet, steamed spinach. Any spinach. \n\nWhile it can reach some low lows, it can reach some of the highest highs in vegetabledom.","Most vegetables, except egg plant. Still hate it.","Blue cheese and Gorgonzola. Hated ‚Äòem as a kid. 21 years old and in summer ROTC training, for some reason I thought, ‚ÄúBleu cheese dressing sounds good today‚Äù, and so it was. üòä","Olives","Brussel sprouts. When I was 7, I begged mom to buy them because they looked like Barbie sized cabbages. Mom told me that I‚Äôd have to eat them since she wasn‚Äôt going to waste them and I agreed. They were terrible. \n\nTo be fair, they were boiled. They weren‚Äôt a delicious concoction of roasted sprouts with a balsamic reduction and crumbled Benton‚Äôs bacon like mom does them now. I regularly request them with a meal when I go visit.","Mushrooms","Eggs. I was disgusted by them as a kid, then I found the way I like them prepared (which is any style really, but well-made).","Three things...brussel sprouts. Roasting instead of boiling changes everything. \n\nColeslaw. Child me would be trying to slap the stuff away if he saw me wolfing it down now. I really love the version they make at Cane's...usual ask for double portions instead of the fries there. \n\nPumpkin pie. Sweet potato pie is still better, but I got over myself and really gave it a try. Better than I remembered it. Quite enjoy it now.","Various filet fish steaks, as long as they don't smell fishy. Such as, teriyaki salmon steak, or swordfish fried in something with garlic. Lobster tail. Shrimp. \n\nWhen I was 8, my dad took us to a restaurant, and he got a fish meal. Picked it up, and sucked the eyes out of it. I almost puked, and wouldn't touch seafood for almost 20 years.","Mustard","Brussel sprouts. When I was growing up, most vegetables were boiled within an inch of their lives. Plus, new varieties that are less bitter have been introduced. Now, a roasted or grilled brussel sprout with olive oil and balsamic or garlic  is one of my favorites. If you had told me that when I was 20, I would have called your crazy.","You guys were allowed to refuse food as a kid? lol","Beets! Mom always heated up store bought canned beets. Nasty as hell. Tried some boiled straight from my grandpas garden and holy hell. So good.","Pineapple :) i had only ever had the tiny sour ones in the Dole fruit cups. My first time trying fresh pineapple a few years ago was life changing lol","Corn. My mom always made creamed corn and I hated it. I was about 17 before I had really good corn on the cob and it was like heaven.","Pickles. Anything with vinegar in it.","Rice. I absolutely hated rice, turns out I just didn't like the way it was cooked."],"settings":{"offline":false,"accent":"com.mx"}}
