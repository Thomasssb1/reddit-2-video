{"text":["If it came out that we were 100% living in a simulation, what would be the biggest indicator looking back?","All the “deja vu” moments. Like mf I’ve played this level already","How arbitrary the speed of light limit is. It’s just the read/write speed limit of the hard drive we are living in!","The baader-meinhof phenomenon- lazy coding like GTA, you see a car for the first time and the next day you see it everywhere","Never seeing my neighbours carrying in groceries.","Things would re-appear only when I stop looking for it. If that’s not a dead give away that we’re living in a simulation, I don’t know what is.\n\nAnd don’t forget about hair pins and hair ties. Where do they even go???","We went from the Wright brothers flying the first plane to space missions in roughly 50 years. That’s wild imo. I don’t think people realize how quickly tech evolves.","That it never fails that once you start to get a little bit ahead in life, your car’s check engine light comes on","Look at the video game industry, and all the progress made in only fifty years. We went from dots and bars on a screen to photorealistic characters and full scale worlds. \n\nNow extrapolate this progress out say....1,000 years? I don't think it's inconceivable to think that we might be able to simulate an entire galaxy by then. \n\nAnd if we can, someone else might already have.","The double slit experiment - the act of observation having an effect on an outcome.","I can sometimes think of a movie or a song. And that bitch either shows up in some form on my suggestions or my actual television.","Our sims can play the sims.","From 1923 until 1956 scientists thought that humans had 48 chromosomes (24 pairs). In 1956, scientists counted the correct number, 46 (23 pairs). \n\nWhat actually happened was that they patched the simulation for smooth running and reduced the chromosome number for better processing.","Clearly that some people have their settings on Easy Mode and others are on Survival Mode. You ever met someone who literally never has or had any issues? Easy childhood, solid upbringing with good parents, smart, good looking, gets the job they want, healthy relationship, financially stable… that’s an NPC on the Easy Mode for sure.","Some people getting a head knock and suddenly becoming geniuses. Or people waking from accidents or surgery and speaking with a foreign accent from countries they ve never been to.","Who's controlling me and why did you make me so awkward","Half the population has no inner monologue.  They're just wandering around, following their programming, with nothing running between their ears.  \n\nAlso, the fact that the most amusing outcome is usually the one we get.  \n\nIt's like you put Sim City on pause, went to the washroom, then your kid brother unpaused it and started dropping all the disasters and fucking everything up.","When observed from the surface of the earth, the moon has the exact same diameter as the sun. \n\nIt's because the Sun has a diameter about 400 times greater than the Moon, yet is also 400 times further away.\n\nWhat are the odds of that happening by pure chance?","The stupidity of some people makes me believe we are 100 percent in a simulation","Going into a room and forgetting what i was gonna do. We're sims and they cancelled the action.","There's an old HFY story about humanity finding out our entire known universe is a simulation. Rather than take it lying down, humans get mad, and do something about it. I went and found the [original screenshot of the story](https://i.imgur.com/8KrABb5.png). Thematically relevant to this thread, and a story I really like, if you got 5 minutes, give it a read.","Our ancestors’ claims of their supposed ghost-sightings may indicate that the simulation before had numerous imperfections. In contrast, currently, there has been a gradual decrease in ghost-sightings which may indicate that the simulation had improved, and may continue to improve in the future.","The limitation of speed of light. It's one of the biggest clues that we may in fact not be in a base reality.","Thinking about something then getting an advertisement for it online.","When the fly landed on Mike Pence's head."],"settings":{"offline":false,"accent":"com.mx"}}
