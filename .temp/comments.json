{"text":["What's the most disturbing piece of audio there is?","Jim Jones talking into a microphone while his followers poison their children.","The 911 call of the woman whose chimp was eating her friend's face.","This one is accompanied by video, but the reaction of a man whose wife gets killed when a brick flies off the back of a truck they were driving behind on a highway and came through their windshield. The audio was captured by their dash cam, one of those things you can't unhear.","The 911 call of the lady stuck in her car in a flood and the operator is so unhelpful, she ends up drowning on the other end of the phone..","I'd venture that the Toolbox Killers audio recording of them torturing and raping Shirley Ledford is probably pretty high up on the list.\n\nIt has never been released to the public, or leaked, but there does exist the full transcript online.","That 911 call from the guy trapped in one of the twin towers","Jared from Subway talking about how he likes kids who come from bad homes because they are easier to manipulate into having sex. Don't don't don't listen to it","The 911 call from the attack of Travis the Chimpanzee.\n\nTravis' screams can be heard in the background at the start of the tape as Herold(owner of Travis) pleads for the police, who initially believed the call to be a hoax until she said, \"He's eating her!\"","The Apollo 1 crew.","Probably the audio of Timothy Treadwell and his girlfriend getting eaten by bears.","the 911 call from one of the teachers present at the columbine school shooting. you can hear the gunshots and the gunmen cheering and whooping. you also hear when they enter the library, which is where they killed the most students. it’s chilling","For me personally, it's audio and video.\nIt's a grandmother who killed her son-in-law \nAnd for some reason the police bring in the woman's young granddaughter / daughter of the victim.\n\nAnd the grandmother is insane and asks for a hug and the little girl screams \"No you killed me daddy!\" \n\nI honestly have no idea why the police brought in the girl, it's horrible.","The woman who helped build the case against Jared from Subway by recording him talking about his enjoyment of pedophilia. \n\nListening to a couple minutes of him describing what he’s done made me want to vomit. The process of getting this stuff on tape wrecked the woman’s mental health, and it’s easy to see why.","The cult leader from the documentary *Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey* where he records his rape of a young girl in his secret room in which only the most devout followers are allowed.  It's haunting.","By all accounts, it's the Norris and Bittaker tapes. Otherwise known as the toolbox killers. I've seen a transcript. Deeply unpleasant stuff.","Me: frustrated that no one is posting links\n\nAlso me: glad that no one is posting links","The 911 call of Loretta Pickard, a disabled elderly woman who died in a house fire. She was physically unable to get out of the house on her own. There were firefighters outside her house, but due to a miscommunication, they thought the house was empty. On the call, you hear the woman talking as the fire gets worse and she gets closer to death.","The Ruth Price 911 call where she’s this old woman living alone in her apartment when some stranger keeps trying to get in. He eventually does and then she can be heard screaming for her life (I think he was stabbing her). Fortunately, she survived and lived another 14 years. \n\nPretty sure it was used to train dispatch in the past for how horrific the audio is.","I’d imagine the tape of 10 year old Lesley Anne Downey’s rape and murder made by the [Moors Murderers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moors_murders) would be a contender. It’s never been released—thankfully—though I’ve seen plenty of interviews with the policemen who had to listen to tape and you can just see on their faces how much it affected them.","There is a phone call tape in the *Fog of War* where President Johnson tells Robert McNamara that he kept his mouth shut as Kennedy tried to de-escalate the Vietnam conflict and now that he’s president he wanted McNamara to build a plan to reverse that strategy and get results.\n\nAs that decision led to my father fighting there and coming back as a man changed for the worse, I’ll say that was my most disturbing audio.\n\nEdit: [Here](https://youtu.be/myWfWk1IQrw) is the link to the clip from the movie.","The voicemail my stepfather left my mom the morning of 9/11.\n\nHe worked on the 99th floor, and called to tell us he was okay, and was making his way down the stairs. He said he would call us again when he was outside. (He never did.)\n\nIn the call, you can hear him telling others to keep their heads down, out of the smoke, but what really makes the audio as disturbing as it is... is the screaming. The screams in the background are some of the most bone-chillingly real terror I think I've ever heard.","The one where these two teens go into this guy's basement and without them knowing he's waiting down there with his gun and shoots both of them and can hear the guy say something right before he shoots girl as she's trying to go back up the stairs. I can't remember all what happened but that was pretty chilling. Maybe someone here knows what I'm talking about.","I’m sure others have mentioned it, but one that really, truly upset me was when a poor delivery lady had mistakenly driven into flood waters.  She called 911 and the dispatcher was cruel beyond words.  I’ll never forget it.","The Weepy Voiced Killer. He killed women, completely mutilated them and proceeded to call the police while crying about what happened and how he can't stop himself. Then he'd hang up and do it again."],"settings":{"offline":false,"accent":"com.mx"}}
