Dude is sus as fuck.Steven Seagal should be charged for fraud.Tom Cruise. Like, gnarly crimes.Gwyneth Paltrow gives the same vibes as that old-times my serial killer who would bathe in the blood of poor young virgins to retain a youthful appearanceDr Phil is an alcoholic wife abuser. I have no proof but just wait. \n\n\nI also would not be surprised if Josh peck killed someone for the Italian mafiaJames Corden. Can’t really explain it either.Round up all of these actors.  Put them in one movie.  Don't tell them why they are selected. Jared Leto, Tom Cruise, Andy Dick, James Cordon, Dr. Phil, Ellen, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ezra Miller...\n\nGet Tarantino to direct it.Quentin Tarantino. His close relation with Harvey Weinstein and the way he defended Roman Polanski makes me think he has done some things as well.[ Removed by Reddit ]Ezra miller is faster at getting into controversies than the flash is at runningDrake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no doubt in my mind that in the next few years he will be outted as a serial pedophile child abuser and the only reason he hasnt already is because of his power in the music industry and how much money he makes record labels. I'm waiting on that dayActual cannibal Shia LaBeoufEllen DeGeneresJim Bob DuggarYou guys are mostly naming celebrities that have actually committed real crimes. I came here for wild, baseless speculation! Example: Kristen Chenowith is a secret polygamist.Dan SchneiderI'm legit surprised that it has taken this long for Kevin Spacey to go to trial.  Like at the start of the #MeToo movement a ton of sexual assaults came to light.  That was like half a decade ago.no one said elon musk??? def elon muskKylie Jenner.....you just know it.[deleted]Salman Khan, the Bollywood actor from India (not the khan Academy’s Sal Khan)\n\nThis guy killed one and injured 4 in a 2002 hit-and-run incident. Blamed it on his driver. Was charged after 10 years. Convicted and then on appeal won due to lack of evidence\n\nSeparately this guy is a well known mafia, along with his cousins and controls the distribution of Bollywood movies. If anyone crosses this guy, their career goes bye-bye[deleted]I can also see Jimmy Fallon being a straight up serial killer.\n\n\nImagine the last thing you see is him Fallon Laughing, doing a Seinfeld impression while sharpening some torture tools like ‘what’s the deal with murder victims? Their names aren’t usually Vic *or* Tim! heh heh heh heh’100% Leonardo DiCaprio. I know everyone thinks its a joke - but its fucking weird that the guy literally cannot date any girl older then mid twenties. And also he keeps going for these “aspiring” models."}
