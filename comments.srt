54
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,900
i do think it's
55
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,500
in bad taste but
56
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,100
i understand why
57
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,800
people are making
58
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,300
jokes as well I
59
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,700
think it's too
60
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,900
far out of a
61
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,300
normal persons
62
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,000
experience to see
63
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,600
someone who paid
64
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,000
a quarter of a
65
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,500
million dollars
66
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,800
to go into an
67
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,900
unregulated
68
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,600
vessel to look on
69
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,100
the wreckage of
70
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,700
the titanic from
71
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,400
a screen with the
72
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,500
whole thing
73
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,200
piloted with a 40
74
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,300
dollar game
75
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,800
controller with
76
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,400
many bad reviews
77
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,700
it borders on
78
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,000
satire and is
79
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,100
just absurd
80
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,700
enough for a lot
81
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,300
of people to not
82
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,600
register that
83
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,200
there are actual
84
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,400
people going
85
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,100
through something
86
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,600
awful
87
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,200
I mean The jokes
88
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,500
kind of write
89
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,800
themselves at
90
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,200
this point The
91
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,900
CEO is down there
92
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,500
and he's the one
93
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,900
that wanted to
94
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,300
save money and
95
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,200
skip some
96
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,700
important steps
97
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,300
No I don't think
98
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,700
they're in bad
99
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,900
taste I also
100
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,000
don't think
101
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,500
they're jokes I
102
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,100
think we're at a
103
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,700
point in society
104
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,600
where the
105
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,200
friction between
106
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,600
regular people
107
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,900
and the ultra
108
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,900
wealthy is
109
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,600
fostering genuine
110
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,200
hate And I don't
111
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
think it's
112
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,700
unjustified Why
113
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,400
would the average
114
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,700
man mourn the
115
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,700
death of a
116
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,800
billionaire
117
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,600
taking a
118
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,500
frivolous
119
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,900
expensive trip
120
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,300
and having the
121
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,900
hubris to ignore
122
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,800
the risks
123
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,400
What I find kind
124
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,000
of shitty is the
125
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,500
resources being
126
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,200
spent on this and
127
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,100
the media
128
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,700
attention vs the
129
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,400
refugee ship that
130
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,300
went down
131
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,700
Bad taste sure
132
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,700
But that's
133
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,100
sometimes what
134
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,500
makes it funny
135
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,200
People make jokes
136
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,600
about terrible
137
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,000
events all the
138
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,300
time Those on

celebrating it
141
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,800
though those are
142
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,900
psychopaths

removed
144
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,900
Nope The rich

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,700
from the Darwin

148
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,900
feel bad for is
149
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,600
the kid
150
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Someone on
151
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,300

152
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,800
that her father
153
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,200
died in a high
154
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,900
profile
155
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,300
mountaineering
156
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,700
expedition and
157
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,200
said there were
158
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,800
so many comments
159
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,300
on the Internet
160
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,500
about how he
161
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,800
deserved what
162
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,300
happened to him
163
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,500
She said the
164
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,700
families see
165
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,400
those comments it
166
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,900
s been 20 years
167
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,100
and it still
168
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,700
hurts That s all
169
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,400
I need to know No
170
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,000
one thinks about
171
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,600
the families not
172
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,200
getting into the
173
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,600
stepson who is
174
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,200
milking it right
175
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,600
now Compassion
176
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,100
folks
177
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,800
I think it has to
178
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,500
do with income If
179
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,100
a poor or middle
180
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,700
class person was
181
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,000
somehow stuck
182
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,700
down there i'd be
183
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,000
horrified and
184
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,700
really hoping for
185
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,900
them to pull
186
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,600
through But these
187
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,900
people aren't
188
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,300
poor or middle
189
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,600
class they're
190
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,100
billionares who
191
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,700
paid more than i
192
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,100
make in like 5
193
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,700
years to be down
194
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,100
there and it's
195
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,400
going to cost
196
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,000
them their lives
197
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,400
It's not quite
198
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,800
irony but it's
199
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,300
close Like none
200
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,800
of us poor folk
201
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,500
could even afford
202
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,700
to be in the
203
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,000
situation the
204
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,600
only reason they
205
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,200
are going to die
206
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,700
is because they
207
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,000
had the money
208
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,300
that put them
209
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,500
there in the
210
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,200
first place So we
211
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,300
average joe
212
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,900
folkes laugh and
213
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,500
make jokes about
214
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,200
it We like to see
215
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,600
people who are
216
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,100
"above us" this
217
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,600
time economicly
218
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,900
speaking fall
219
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,500
it's funny Is it
220
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,200
in bad taste Sure
221
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,600
But it's still
222
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,100
funny
223
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,200
Objectively
224
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,700
speaking I know
225
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,000
the answer is
226
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,700
"yes" A life is a
227
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,100
life no matter
228
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,800
what that life is
229
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,300
like or what it
230
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,700
did But at the
231
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,300
same time by GOD
232
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,200
the jokes
233
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,900
practically write
234
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,400
themselves This
235
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,800
wasn't a freak
236
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,500
accident like the
237
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,100
titanic or had a
238
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,700
single
239
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,900
identifiable
240
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,500
point of failure
241
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,100
like when Kobe's
242
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,100
helicopter
243
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,700
crashed This was
244
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,800
an absolute
245
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,100
shitshow of a
246
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,300
situation on
247
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,700
every possible
248
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,400
level And somehow
249
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,000
every new bit of
250
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
information just
251
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,000
makes the damn
252
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,600
thing look worse
253
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,700
and worse A
254
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,400
practically jerry
255
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,000
rigged submarine
256
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,500
that was bolted
257
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,800
shut a single
258
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,500
window that was 1
259
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,300
piece of
260
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,800
scrapmetal away
261
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,100
from the Iron
262
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,800
Lung no
263
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,500
navigation system
264
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:07,900
only
265
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,200
communication
266
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,600
system was SMS
267
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,100
controlled by a
268
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,400
30 dollar off
269
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,300
brand PS5
270
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,800
controller made
271
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,500
by a company that
272
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,600
fired their
273
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,000
saftey manager
274
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,700
for not
275
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,400
Greenlighting the
276
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,700
titan because
277
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,200
it's window was
278
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,900
only approved for
279
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,600
a fraction of the
280
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,300
desired depth ran
281
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,500
by a CEO who
282
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,100
complained about
283
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,700
saftey
284
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,200
regulations and
285
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,800
so much more All
286
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,500
of 10 minutes ago
287
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,900
I learned that
288
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,600
the CEO who again
289
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,200
complained about
290
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,400
his industry
291
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,800
being too safe
292
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,200
actively chose
293
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,600
against hiring
294
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,100
people who have
295
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,600
experience with
296
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
submarines
297
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,200
because "50 year
298
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,600
old white guys
299
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,300
aren't inspiring"
300
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,900
I mean seriously
301
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,200
what the fuck
302
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,300
else are we
303
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,700
supposed to do
304
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,400
removed
305
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,900
Of course Those
306
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,500
people are stuck
307
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,000
in a small tube
308
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,700
knowing their air
309
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,100
is running out
310
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,600
and there is no
311
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,000
escape I can't
312
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,600
think of a worst
313
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,500
nightmare
314
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,100
No The pilot was
315
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,600
a fucking moron
316
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,100
and anyone that
317
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,700
believed him I'm
318
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,300
sorry is a short
319
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,800
sighted idiot I
320
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,400
feel bad for the
321
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,800
15 19 year old
322
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,300
That's the only
323
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,700
actual tragedy
324
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,400
removed
325
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,100
One of the people
326
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,700
on the
327
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,300
submersible is a
328
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,000
good friend of my
329
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,600
wife s parents I
330
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,200
ve never met the
331
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,700
guy but my wife

333
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,500
times He s the
334
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,900
one who s been
335
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,000
down to the
336
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,600
Titanic 35 times
337
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,300
before I get it I
338
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,900
don t think he s
339
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,600
a billionaire and
340
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,100
rich people are
341
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,800
still people with
342
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,000
thoughts and
343
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,400
feelings but I
344
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
also don t
345
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,900
understand what
346
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,400
the fuck he was
347
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,700
doing on this
348
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,400
thing Some people
349
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,800
just want that
350
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
feeling of
351
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,300
adventure My in
352
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,900
laws say they re
353
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,400
both devastated
354
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,700
but he always
355
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,400
kind of lived his
356
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,000
life on the edge
357
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,400
He was also in
358
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,100
his 70s and had a
359
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,700
good life I feel
360
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,200
bad for that 19
361
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,000
year old
362
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,700
A lot of comments
363
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,900
say that the
364
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,000
jokes are a
365
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,600
natural reaction
366
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,000
buts it s just
367
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,700
not applicable to
368
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,200
a lot of people
369
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,400
making these
370
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,700
jokes Many of
371
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,400
them don t see it
372
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,000
as sad or tragic
373
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,200
in the first
374
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,900
place so it s not
375
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,800
a defense
376
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,500
mechanism against
377
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,400
something
378
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,000
horrific There s
379
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,400
no sympathy or
380
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,100
empathy
381
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
whatsoever
382
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,700
Gallows humor is
383
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,900
a legitimate
384
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,500
coping mechanism
385
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,600
at both the
386
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,000
individual and
387
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,500

the jokes edit
413
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,100
shameless plug
414
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,600

submechanophobia
418
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,400
we definitely
419
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,800
appreciate the
420
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,400
sheer terror the
421
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,100
occupants of that
422
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,600
death trap must
423
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,100
be experiencing
424
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,800
doesn't make them
425
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,600
any less
426
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,100
responsible for
427
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,000
their own
428
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,700
decisions to take
429
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,100
such a massive
430
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,000
risk FAFO
431
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,400
Not really The
432
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,700
CEO and pilot
433
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,200
made has made a
434
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,400
lot of silly
435
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,000
statements about
436
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,600
safety that make
437
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,300
this humorous The
438
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,700
occupants know
439
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,100
the risks It s
440
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,500
sad but no the
441
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,000
jokes aren t in
442
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,900
bad taste
443
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,100
If they were
444
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,900
research
445
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,200
scientists or
446
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,900
rescue workers or
447
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,600
something then it
448
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,200
would absolutely
449
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,900
be in bad taste I
450
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,800
think the
451
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,300
absolute idiocy
452
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,800
of the endeavor
453
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,100
makes it fair
454
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,500
game It's like
455
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,000
that missionary
456
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,700
who got merked on
457
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,100
North Sentinel
458
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,800
Island These five
459
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,100
people paid 5
460
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,800
times the average
461
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,300
person's annual
462
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,600
salary to get
463
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,300
into the JANKIEST
464
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,000
looking sub known
465
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,700
to man and charge
466
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,100
headfirst into
467
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,500
the only place
468
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,900
more dangerous
469
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,500
than outer space
470
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,800
There were no
471
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,700
emergency
472
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,800
supplies or
473
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,500
rations no safety
474
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,200
clearances on the
475
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,700
equipment costs
476
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,200
were cut on all
477
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,900
corners there was
478
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,000
no tracking
479
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,300
system in the
480
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,800
vessel no human
481
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,400
waste management
482
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,000
system no vessel
483
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
retrieval plan I
484
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,000
bet they don't
485
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,700
even have fucking
486
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,900
life jackets
487
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,600
There's no way to
488
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,100
exit the vessel
489
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,600
from the inside
490
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,100
so even if they
491
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,600
did surface and
492
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,200
are just lost in
493
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,900
the ocean they'll
494
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,400
still suffocate
495
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,600
In this very
496
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,400
specific
497
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,600
situation we
498
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,000
aren't mocking
499
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,400
the death of 5
500
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,600
people we're
501
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,300
mocking the death
502
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,000
of 5 Billionaires
503
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,700
who were thwarted
504
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,900
by their own
505
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,500
hubris
506
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,100
I think it s bad
507
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,800
taste to make fun
508
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,500
of it I also find
509
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,300
it to be
510
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,600
extremely bad
511
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,100
taste that this
512
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,300
sub has 24 7
513
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,500
coverage and
514
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,100
there s not been
515
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,800
a damned thing on
516
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,400
the news talking
517
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,800
about the boat
518
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,400
that was lost at
519
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,100
sea with hundreds
520
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,600
of people on it
521
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,200
Like come on man
522
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,600
has there been
523
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,900
any survivors
524
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,300
found from the
525
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,900
boat Can t cover
526
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,800
that some
527
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,400
billionaires are
528
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,000
trapped in a tin
529
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,700
can like the fuck
530
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,300
I don't mind the
531
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,600
humor its the
532
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,900
focus I can't
533
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,200
stomach we're
534
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,500
obsessed with
535
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,900
shit like this
536
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,300
while the real
537
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,400
problems go
538
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
unattended
539
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,700
Yeah it s bad
540
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,300
taste but I like
541
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,900
dark humor Humor
542
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,800
makes the
543
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,400
darkness of life
544
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,200
bearable
545
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,700
Its a sad event
546
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,300
but its not like
547
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,800
it was a single
548
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,400
mother and her 4
549
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,100
children dying in
550
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,100
a terrible
551
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,600
accident it was
552
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,100
people who were
553
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,800
so rich and board
554
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,400
that they got in
555
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,900
this shitty sub
556
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,400
to see a sunken
557
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,000
ship its sad but
558
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,600
it was kind of a
559
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,200
dumb thing to do
